```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(xmrr)
# xmr_data and prg are supplied by the .env the render function works from
program_data = xmr_data %>% 
  filter(Program == prg)
```

```{r, include=F}
# This makes sure each chart looks exactly the same
plotter = function(measure, f){
  program_data %>% 
    filter(Measure == measure) %>% 
    xmr_chart2(Year, Value) + 
    geom_text(aes(y = Value, label = f(Value, 1)), vjust = -1)
}
```

```{r, include=F}
# summary stats to be used as in-text examples. 
summary_stats = program_data %>% 
  group_by(Measure) %>% 
  summarise(Max = max(Value), 
            Min = min(Value), 
            Mean = mean(Value),
            `SD` = sd(Value)) %>% 
  mutate(Range = Max - Min)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results = "asis"}
cat("\n#", prg)
```

This is an example of a report that can be automatically generated. 

This document renders as an html file, but the principles apply to all RMarkdown output types. 

### Enrolment

```{r, include=F}
summary_e = summary_stats %>% 
  filter(Measure == "Enrolment")
```

The maximum enrolment for `r prg` is `r summary_e$Max` students, and the minimum is `r summary_e$Min`.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=10}
plotter("Enrolment", f = scales::comma)
```

### Retention Rate

```{r, include=F}
summary_r = summary_stats %>% 
  filter(Measure == "Retention Rate")
```

The average retention rate for `r prg` is `r scales::percent(summary_r$Mean, 1)`, and the standard deviation is `r scales::percent(summary_r$SD, 1)`.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width=10, fig.height=3}
plotter("Retention Rate", f = scales::percent)
```
